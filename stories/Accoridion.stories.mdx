# Accordion

The `Accordion` component is a collapsible container that can be used to hide and show
content. By default, the `Accordion` handles all opening and closing logic under the
hood. However, if you want to control the state of the `Accordion` yourself, you can
do that as well!

It's major reason for existing is to declutter informative or functional content that
isn't necessary to see at all times. It's also a great way to hide content that may
be overwhelming to the user at first glance.

## Functionality

The basic functionality of the accordion is quite simple, it opens and it closes. However,
there are a few different ways to use the `Accordion` component, and that is what we'll
be going over here.

### Basic Accordion

When we refer to an `Accordion` in Apollo, we really mean a single dropdown that can be
opened and closed. This is the most basic use case of the `Accordion` component.

At the most basic level, this component has two required props: `id` and `header`. The
`id` prop is used to identify the `Accordion` component, and the `header` prop is used
to display the header of the `Accordion`.

Everything that would go inside of the `Accordion` component should be placed as children.

It's as simple as that!

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Basic Accordion" args={{ id: 'open-me', header: 'Open Me' }}>
        {BasicAccordion.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

#### Custom Headers

If you don't like the default font or style of the header, that's okay! You can pass
in a custom component through the `header` prop to render your own.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Custom Accordion"
        args={{
            id: 'open-me',
            header: <h1 style={{ color: 'red', background: 'blue', margin: 0 }}>Open Me</h1>,
        }}
    >
        {BasicAccordion.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

```jsx
export default function UI() {
    return (
        <Accordion
            id="open-me"
            header={<h1 style={{ color: 'red', background: 'blue' }}>Open Me</h1>}
        >
            Some content
        </Accordion>
    );
}
```

#### Controlled Accordion

We can decide whether we want to let Apollo deal with the opening and closing logic,
or whether we want to control it ourselves. This can be done through the `override` and `onClick`
properties which are a `boolean` and a `MouseEventHandler` respectively

```jsx
export default function UI() {
    const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

    return (
        <Accordion id="open-me" header="Open Me" override={open} onClick={() => setOpen(!open)}>
            Some content
        </Accordion>
    );
}
```

#### Open by default

If you want to determine whether an `Accordion` is open or closed by default without having to
completely control it, you can use the `defaultOpen` prop. This prop is a `boolean` that will
determine whether the `Accordion` is open or closed on render

```jsx
export default function UI() {
    return (
        <Accordion id="open-me" header="Open Me" defaultOpen>
            Some content
        </Accordion>
    );
}
```

#### Controlling the max height of the panel

When talking about `Accordion` components, we often refer to the panel as the content that
is hidden and shown. The `Accordion` component has a `panelHeight` prop that can be used to
control the maximum height of the panel.

```jsx
export default function UI() {
    return (
        <Accordion id="open-me" header="Open Me" panelHeight="100px">
            Some content
        </Accordion>
    );
}
```

### Accordion Menu

To create an accordion menu, we can just spam a bunch of `Accordion` components together.
Due to the simple nature of the `Accordion` component, it will just push and pull the
content below it as it opens and closes.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Accordion Menu">{AccordionMenu.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

#### Controlled Accordion Menu

If you really want to get fancy with it, you can also allow for one-at-a-time opening
and closing of the `Accordion` components. This can be done by controlling the `override`
prop of each `Accordion` component. This would look something like this:

```jsx
export default function UI() {
    const [open, setOpen] = (React.useState < string) | (null > null);

    return (
        <>
            <Accordion
                id="option-1"
                header="Option 1"
                override={open === 'option-1'}
                onClick={() => setOpen('option-1')}
            >
                Content of option 1
            </Accordion>
            <Accordion
                id="option-2"
                header="Option 2"
                override={open === 'option-2'}
                onClick={() => setOpen('option-2')}
            >
                Content of option 2
            </Accordion>
            <Accordion
                id="option-3"
                header="Option 3"
                override={open === 'option-3'}
                onClick={() => setOpen('option-3')}
            >
                Content of option 3
            </Accordion>
        </>
    );
}
```

And act something like this:

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Controlled Accordion Menu">{ControlledAccordionMenu.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

## Other Props & Functionalities

Transition focus to other functionalities. Maybe introduce some of them or talk about
other props briefly. That way the user isn't abruptly introduce to the ArgsTable
