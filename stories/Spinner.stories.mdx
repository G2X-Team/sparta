## Functionality

The functionality of the loading spinner is pretty simple. All you have to do is toggle
the `loading` prop to true, and you will be able to see this spinner in action. You can
play around with this feature below.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Default State">{DefaultState.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

### Customization

The spinner is also highly customizable to fit the needs and wants of your application.

#### Colors

The spinner supports two types of color changes. The prop `color` refers to the color of the
spinner itself, while the `innerColor` prop refers to the color of the spinner's inner circle
(This is likely to change in the near future).

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Different Color Spinners">{DifferentColorSpinners.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

#### Sizes

The spinner can also have different sizes, meaning that it will always be able to fit the
dimensions that you need it to, making it highly versatile for your usecase.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Different Size Spinners">{DifferentSizeSpinners.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

#### Variants

You can also customize your spinner using the `variant` prop. These variants are theme based
meaning that if you want quick access to designated colors to your theme, you can do so by
using the variant props.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Different Variant Spinners">{DifferentVariantSpinners.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>
