# Menu Component

This component will be used for all components who need some kind of menu interface. Among them we
have use cases such as `Dropdown` and `Drawer`.

## Functionality

At first glance, it might not look like much, but this component holds secrets to streamlining
accessibility and improving the workflow with components that have menus. By default this component
supports several behaviors:

-   **`listbox`:** when there are immediate `Option` components as children
-   **`application`:** when there are no immediate `Option` components as children

There is also a prop enabled behavior:

-   **`navigation`:** when the content redirects to a different page within the domain

Additionally, you can add `Header` and `Footer` components to further create layout as needed for
all types of menus.

### `listbox` Menus

A `listbox` is a design pattern enforced by WCAG 2.0 as a means of communicating when there is a
list of items (typically belonging to set). What this means is that for our screen reader users,
they will hear indeces of these `Option` components and know how many elements there are just by
tabbing through the options.

This is a huge plus for accessibility, and all you had to do was add the `Option` component as
a child to the `Menu`, the rest was handled by us magically 😉

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Listbox Menu" args={{ label: 'Menu Component' }}>
        {ListboxMenu.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### `application` Menus

An application menu typically refers to the use of menus beyond just listing out data. This is going
to be most useful when you need extra functionality than what a typical `listbox` provides. For this
specific functionality you are going to have to provide a `description` to let our hearing users
know what's going on.

> **Fair warning:** this component will throw given several requirements aren't met:
>
> -   Multiple `Header`/`Footer` components: This component recognizes these components and will
>     format them accordingly. However, it won't like it if you add multiple headers as the immediate
>     children. Easy enough right?
> -   Don't add a `description`: When in application mode, there isn't a lot of detail being given
>     to our screen-reader users. By us throwing, we ensure that you don't forget to make whatever
>     you're building accessible to all.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Application Menu"
        args={{
            label: 'Menu Component',
            description: 'This is a special menu that you can interact with',
            height: 200,
            width: 400,
            padding: 10,
        }}
    >
        {ApplicationMenu.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### `navigation` Menus

These are the kind of menus that link to other pages. This is specifically designed for when you are
using this menu to collapse navigation options. This is useful to let your users know that the options
will redirect you elsewhere

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Navigation Menu" args={{ label: 'Menu Component', navigation: true }}>
        {NavigationMenu.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Other Props & Functionalities

For reference, we have a complete list of the properties and everything else down here. I would ignore
`parentProps` unless you are a dev contributing to the `Menu` component.
