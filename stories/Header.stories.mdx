# Header

The `Header` is an interfacing component whose functionality only truly shows within other
components in Sparta. It's intended use is to signify when a webpage has some kind of titular
content.

## Functionality

This section we'll be going over the functionality of the `Header` component along with its
use cases.

### Standalone

Standalone, you can see that there is nothing really special about the `Header` component. That's
because it really isn't, it's just a `<header />` tag.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Standalone Header" args={{ children: 'This is a Header' }}>
        {StandaloneHeader.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Use in supported Sparta Containers

Inside other containers, the `Header` component actually behaves much live a `View` component in
the sense that it can be used to further layout special Sparta components without them losing their
functionality. However, what makes it different, is that the `Header` component is will always be on
the top of whatever supported Sparta container it is used in.

#### Example using `Card`

We won't be going over every container it's used in, but the `Card` will give you a good idea of
how it works.

<Canvas withSource="open">
    <Story name="Header in Card" args={{ children: "WRONG!" }}>
        {HeaderInCard.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Other Props & Functionalities

That's pretty much it! It's a very simple component and doesn't really have any special props 
or functionality. Just in case though, we'll show you the very small prop table it comes with :)
