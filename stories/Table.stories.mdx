# Table

If you hate making tables from scratch, this component is for you. The Sparta table
component is the answer for any basic table, complete with built in sorting,
customization, easy composition, and more.

## Functionality

The table component is a component that supports a suite of features geared towards
making tables the quickest possible, with everything you could possibly want.

### Creating a table

To create a table, it's quite simple as long as you understand two concepts:

1. What kind of data we accept
2. How we determine what columns you want rendered.

#### What kind of data does the table accept?

When creating the table, we wanted to keep in mind that different people, manage their
data differently. In the search for flexibile and low-code solutions, we opted to support
2 data types:

-   A 2-D Array of data: `ReactNode[][]` (Each nested array must have the same length)
-   An array of objects: `{ [key: string]: ReactNode }[]`

> `ReactNode` is any renderable data in React, think of it like the React-friendly `any` type.

Meaning, if you're data looks like either of the exapmles below, you should be fine.

```typescript
// exapmle of 2D array
const twoD = [
    ['hello there', 2, 4, 3],
    ["what's up", 5, 1, 3],
    /* ... */
];

// example of an array of objects
const objArr = [
    { message: 'hello there', code: 2, friends: 4, family: 3 },
    { message: "what's up", code: 5, friends: 1, family: 3 },
    /* ... */
];
```

#### How do we determine what data to render?

For the table, we wanted it to be super easy to manipulate the content, to
be able to accomplish this task. Furthermore, we needed the data to be structured the way
we mentioned above so we could create the `Table.Column`.

To simplify the concept, if you think about your data as a table, the enclosing
array are the rows, and the object inside is responsible for keeping track of the columns.
Likewise, the `Table.Column` will attempt to relate to the content within the enclosing
array using whatever indexing the inner object uses. To visualize this look at the example
below:

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Rendering Data with Columns">{RenderingDataWithColumns.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

### Doing more

While having a component that renders tables nicely is cool and all that, we also need
to consider functionality, customization, etc.

#### Customizing Header

While in the previous example we should the column header to be a string, this property
can contain any data type. Including custom elements. You don't have to worry about
compatibility either. If it can be contained in one element, it should be compatible to
all the functionalities we have for it. Just add your custom column header in the
`header` prop, and call it a day.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Custom Column Header">{CustomHeaders.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

#### Customizing Contents

Sometimes there is data that we would like to format further, like a date. Or maybe
other times you just want full control of what goes on in a specific column of data.
For those times, we have a `dataRenderer` property, which has the type of `DataRenderer`.
This function works as follows:

> Below are just some examples of use, but you could return any return type that is
> react renderable.

```typescript
// if you just want the default behavior
const renderDate: DataRenderer = (date) => {
    const newDate = new Date(date as string).getTime();
    return newDate;
};
```

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Customizing Contents">{CustomCells.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

#### Sorting data

Another neat thing you can do with the `Table.Column` is specify whether you want to
be able to sort by the content of a given column. Currently we support 3 different
types of content sort:

-   `string`
-   `date`
-   `number`

By inputting your desired sorting type in the `sort` prop, you can sort the entire
visible dataset by that column.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Sort Column">{SortColumn.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

#### Controlling rows

Sometimes there comes a time where a column might want to use the data of the entire
row, or you want some functionality the depends on the row rather than a single data
point. For that, you can use the `rowHandler` function which is of `RowHandler` type.

Similar to controlling the cell content, you can pass a method that takes in the data
(which now will be row data instead of cell data), and return a component to render.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Control Row">{ControllingRows.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

#### Pagination

Another great feature we have is pagination. Don't worry about implementing it yourself,
because we have it! All you have to do is add the max amount of content you want on the
page in the `pagination` prop, and we handle the rest!

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Pagination Example">{ElaborateExample.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

#### Alignment

What table is complete without alignment? That is why we added it too. Currently, you
can align the content of both header and data cells by just passing the type of alignment
between `"center"`, `"left"`, and `"right"`.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Alignment Sample">{ControllingAlignment.bind({})}</Story>
</Canvas>

#### Formatting with Grid

We understand that another annoying part of creating tables is ensuring the optimal spacing,
that's why we decided that if you wanted to, you can do it easily with the `columns` prop.
Much like the [Grid](/docs/layout-grid--default), by adding the appropriate `grid-template-column`
formatting, you can determine how the column spacing behaves!

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Column Spacing with Grid" args={{ columns: 'auto 1fr' }}>
        {ControllingColumnSpacing.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Other Props & Functionalities

For a quick reference of properties, you can also refer to the prop tables below:

### `Table` Props

<ArgsTable of={Table} />

### `Table.Column` Props
<ArgsTable of={Table.Column} />
