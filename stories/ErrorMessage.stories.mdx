## Functionality

The `ErrorMessage` is a very simple component to use. It's only intended to be used as a means of
displaying errors in an accessible, and uniform way in compliance to Sparta standards. To use it
you simply pass the message through the component's tags and set the `active` prop to `true` and
you will be able to see it.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Standalone Error"
        args={{ id: 'error-message', active: true, children: 'I am an error' }}
    >
        {StandaloneError.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Setup

In the case you want to use the `ErrorMessage`, make sure that the element the error is being 
displayed for has its `aria-errormessage` prop set to the `id` of this component. This will tell
the user where the error came from.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Proper use of Error Messages"
        args={{ id: 'error-message', active: true, children: 'I a loading error' }}
    >
        {ProperUseOfErrorMessage.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
