# Button

The Button component is probably one of the biggest forms of input that Sparta has to offer.
Something as simple as the button can make or break the experience for the user, and our aim
was to make it as familiar as possible.

## Functionality

Functionally these buttons would work as you would expect them to. You hover or tab over it and
click or `space`/`enter` it, you will execute the `onClick` callback. Pretty simple stuff. We only
added very few additional features to it so it isn't too much of a pain to learn how to use.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Standard Button" args={{ children: "Click Me" }}>
        {StandardButton.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Customization

The buttons can recieve customization both in aesthetics and functionality.

#### Variants

The Button component for the moment only has 2 visual states that can be switched using the
`variant` prop. These are the `"default"` and `"secondary"` variants. These variants can just
be thought of two different style versions of the same element with no actual functional
difference.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Button Variants">
        {(args) => (
            <>
                <Button>Solid</Button>
                <span style={{ paddingRight: 10 }} />
                <Button variant="outline">Outline</Button>
                <span style={{ paddingRight: 10 }} />
                <Button variant="none">None</Button>
            </>
        )}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

#### References

Since you can put references in a regular `button` element, we wanted to retain that functionality
in Sparta. So if you find the need, don't shy away from using references, we support them :)

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Button Refs">
        {ButtonRefs.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Loading state

The button actually comes with a built in loading state that when enabled, will disabled the button
and render a spinner within it. This is useful for instances where you need to wait for a response in
a given form. To activate it all you have to do is toggle its `loading` prop to `true` as seen below.

> **Note:** This component will also have an `aria-busy` attribute set to `true` when loading so that
> screen readers will know that the button is loading.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Loading Button">
        {LoadingButton.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Other Props & Functionalities

For a full breakdown of all the additional props, refer to the table below. Also take into
consideration that this is a normal HTML `button`, and has all of the properties of one as well.
