# Dropdown

The Dropdown component can be thought of as this provider that fasciliates the implementation of
your standard Dropdown. Now worrying about opening and closing, accessibility, and the other
hassles that typically come with this component.

## References

These are some of the components that we use in the Dropdown. You might benefit from taking a look
at them:

## Functionality

The Dropdown component is another example of a provider that implements the `Menu` component. Since
we can typically attribute a dropdown menu to a single button, we don't want to accept any further
layout outside of what we've provided. This means that the only supported children of the `Dropdown`
is a `Button` or `Icon` and a `Menu`.

### Different Button Variations?

The cool thing that we set out to do with Sparta's dropdown is that we wanted the user to have a
lot of flexibility in how they wanted to implement the dropdown button, other than using our own
`Button` component.

#### Standard Button

For the regular button all you got to do is wrap your `Button` or `Icon` with the `Dropdown`
component and pass in the `Menu` component as a child and you're good to go. No need to worry
about the rest, because wo do it under the hood.

> **Fair warning:** Trying to add more than one `Menu` to a `Dropdown` will result in an error.
> The same applies to `Button` components and `Icon` components.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Basic Dropdown" height="150px">
        {BasicDropdown.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

#### Icon Buttons

Like we said previously, the `Dropdown` supports a `Button` or `Icon` as a child. This means that
in order to have a working `Icon` dropdown, all you have to do is add it in place of a `Button`
as a child. Sparta will identify the `Icon` as the dropdown button and you are done.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Icon Dropdown" height="150px">
        {IconDropdown.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Avatar Button

We can also use an `Avatar` as a dropdown button, this is especially useful for creating user menus.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Avatar Dropdown" height="150px">
        {AvatarDropdown.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

#### More Button Options?

Well, you know how we said you can use other components as dropdown buttons other than our own, right?
All you have to do to accomplish that is use the style-less variant of the `Button` component. You can
think of this as a clickable `<a>` tag. Just wrap whatever you want to wrap inside of the `Button` and
boom! You have a dropdown button completely styled to your liking.

> **Fair warning:** Since the area `Button` kind of lets you do whatever you want, you have to be aware
> that adding elements with nested clickable elements would render this component unaccessible for
> keyboard users. Just make sure that whatever you put in there doesn't have an selectable element
> and you should be good to go ðŸ™‚

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Area Dropdown" height="150px">
        {AreaDropdown.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Anchoring & Alignment

For this one, we'll just let you play around with it. Changing the `anchor` prop will change the
point at which the dropdown menu will be anchored to the button. The `alignment` prop will change
the alignment of the dropdown menu in relation to the button.

> To play around with anchor and alignment, go to the "Canvas" section of storybook and click one
> "Anchoring the Dropdown" under Layout > Dropdown

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Anchoring the Dropdown" height="400px">
        {AnchoringTheDropdown.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
