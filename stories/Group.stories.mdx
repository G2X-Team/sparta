# Group

The Group component is responsible for handling inputs that are logically grouped together. Such as
radios and checkboxes.

## References

This component uniquely implements the `Radio` and `Checkbox` to give them some extra functionality.
You might benefit from checking out the documentation for those components:

-   [Checkbox](?path=/docs/form-checkbox--default)

## Functionality

The `Group` functionally works like a `fieldset` in the sense that it's purpose is to logically group
together inputs of the same type. However, it has some more functionality that makes dealing with
checkboxes and radios easier.

> **Note:** Best practice is that you only have one type of input per group. This is to make sure that
> every group is logically organized by input and high-level responsibility. Having multiple types of
> inputs in the same group can causeto confusion for Screen Readers and their users. You should also
> avoid the use of nested `Groups` for the same reasons.

### Describing the Group

The Group has a `label` prop that is used to describe the group, we make this property required so
that we can ensure an accessible experience is provided to all users. If you like, you can even add
a `hint` prop to provide more information to the user. This can be especially helpful if you have
requirements for the functionality of the `Group`.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Group Labels" args={{ label: 'Radios', hint: 'Select any radio that you want' }}>
        {RadioGroup.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Radios & Checkboxes

This component unlocks some extra functionality when there is a Radio or Checkbox involved

#### `onChange`

The `onChange` function doesn't refer to the overall state of the `Group`, instead all `Radio` and
`Checkbox` in the `Group` will trigger the same function. This can be useful for keeping state of
the inputs or just to be pinged whenever an input changes.

> **Note:** The `onChange` function only targets a specific group of inputs. If the `Radio` is
> implemented first, only `Radio` components will trigger the `onChange` function, and vice-versa.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Group change callback" args={{ label: 'Radios' }}>
        {RadioGroup.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

#### Basic Layout

We also added the `inline` prop to handle basic layout cases. You want all your inputs to be side
by side? Just add the `inline` prop and you can accomplish that effect!

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Inline Groups" args={{ label: 'Radios', inline: true }}>
        {RadioGroup.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

#### Default Values

We wanted the `Group` to be especially easy to use with default values, so we added the `defaultValue`
prop. This prop can either be a string or an array of strings. If you register a string as the default
value, the component will automatically select the corresponding `Radio`. If you register an array of
strings, the component will automatically select the corresponding `Checkbox` components. Simple right?
Here's an example:

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Default Values" args={{ label: 'Radios', defaultValue: '1' }}>
        {RadioGroup.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Props Applicable to All

We want you to have full control of all inputs within the `Group` at all times. To help you with
this endeavor, we have provided some properties to the group that will impact all inputs in the
`Group`.

For now, we have provided the following props:

-   `disabled`: disables all properties within the `Group`

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Group disabling" args={{ disabled: true, label: 'Checkboxes' }}>
        {CheckboxGroup.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Its use in the `Form`

The `Group` gains behavior when used in the `Form` component.

#### Client Form

The `Group` gets super powers in the `Form` as it will keep state of all children values. This
allows you to keep track of all the input values within a group. This is especially useful for
keeping state of the `Radio` and `Checkbox` inputs. The object that represents the state of the
`Group` is returned by the `Form` component as a `FormGroupData` type. That looks something like
this:

```typescript
/** Form data that you can expect from client-side toggle inputs within a group */
export type FormGroupData = { radio?: string; checkbox?: string[] };

/** And it's used like this */
const onSubmit: FormSubmitHandler = (data) => {
    // this is what getting the radio value look like
    const radiosGroup: FormGroupData = data.radios;
    const { radio: value } = radiosValues;

    // this is what getting the checkbox values look like
    const checkboexesGroup: FormGroupData = data.checkboxes;
    const { checkboxes: values } = checkboxesValues;
};
```

In practice, all you have to do is put the `Group` component in the `Form` from Sparta, and it will
automatically adopt these behaviors without further configuration via the magic of Sparta. You can
see how its behaviors differ by looking at the example below in contrast to previous examples:

> **Note:** You can make groups required for submission by adding a `required` prop to the `Group`

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Group in Client Form">
        {GroupInClientForm.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

#### Remix Form

In the Remix Form the `Group` is in charge of spreading the default values and or errors to the
respective inputs. This means that if you provide your Remix typed `Form` with an `actionData`
object, the `Group` will handle **all** of the rendering. For the follwoing example we will
use this:

```typescript
const actionData: FormActionData = {
    fields: {
        radios: '1',
        checkboxes: ['1', '2'],
    },
    fieldErrors: {
        checkboxes: 'All three checkboxes should be checked',
    },
};
```

Again, implementation is super easy. You don't have to do any configuration other than add the
`actionData` object to its respective `Form` prop and add the `Group` as a child between the
`Form` component's tags.

> **Fair warning:** The `Group` doesn't keep state of the inputs when in the "remix" Form 
> because it's validation is solely reliant on the `actionData` provided by the Remix action 
> function.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Group in Remix Form">
        {GroupInRemixForm.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
