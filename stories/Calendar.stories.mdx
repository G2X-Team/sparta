# Calendar

The `Calendar` component is the solution for all your date picking and calendar needs

## Table of Contents

Add a table of contents so that users can quickly look over the documentation with
convenient hyperlinks. Also link to headers that you place throughout to elaborate
on the sections. This will be useful for the user when they have to scroll over
everything.

## Functionality

The `Calendar` at it's most basic level, is just a visual controller for selecting dates.
It can be used to select a date by clicking on a date, or by using the keyboard to navigate
to a date and pressing enter.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Standard Calendar" args={{ id: 'standard' }}>
        {StandardCalendar.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Starting Date

By default the calendar will always start on the current month. However, you can set the
`startingDate` prop to a date object to start the calendar on a different month.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Different Starting Day" args={{ id: 'start', startDate: '2020-04-20' }}>
        {StandardCalendar.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Valid Date Ranges

The `Calendar` can be used to select a date within a range of dates. This is done by
setting the `dateRange` prop to an array of date strings. If the `dateRange` has only
one date, then all dates from that point on will be valid. If the `dateRange` has two
dates, then all dates between those two dates will be valid.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Valid Date Range"
        args={{ id: 'dr', startDate: '2020-04-20', dateRange: ['2020-04-03', '2020-04-24'] }}
    >
        {StandardCalendar.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Adding Marks to Signfiy Events

The `Calendar` can be used to mark dates that have events. This is done by setting the
`marks` prop to an array of date strings. The dates in the array will be marked with a
dot to signify that there is an event on that date.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Marked Dates"
        args={{
            id: 'marked',
            startDate: '2020-04-20',
            marks: ['2020-04-03', '2020-04-24', '2020-04-20'],
        }}
    >
        {StandardCalendar.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Date Range Picker

The `Calendar` can be used to select a date range. This is done by setting the
type prop to `range`. The `Calendar` will then allow the user to select a start date
and an end date. The `Calendar` will also allow the user to select a date range by
clicking and dragging on the calendar.

<Canvas>
	<Story
		name="Date Range Picker"
		args={{
			id: 'range',
			startDate: '2020-04-20',
			type: 'range',
			marks: ['2020-04-03', '2020-04-24', '2020-04-20'],
		}}
	>
		{StandardCalendar.bind({})}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

## Other Props & Functionalities

Transition focus to other functionalities. Maybe introduce some of them or talk about
other props briefly. That way the user isn't abruptly introduce to the ArgsTable
