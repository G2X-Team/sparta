# Drawer Component

This component is made with the intention of collapsing content that would otherwise cluttler the
main view. You might want to use this as a fallback for navigation when your header needs to fit in
mobile, or perhaps to show an expanded version of some module.

## Functionality

The way we set up this component is much like a provider. A drawer needs to have an established area
where it will slide out from, so a good idea is that everything you want the drawer to impact should
be wrapped by it. This also gives us flexibility to handle some accessibility issues that drawers
typically face on top of that.

After we've given that information, all we do is add a `Menu` as a child, which we will automatically
associate with the `Drawer`, and boom! We have our first `Drawer`... kind of.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Bare-Minimum Drawer" args={{ label: 'Drawer', type: 'permanent' }}>
        {BareMinimumDrawer.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Standard Implementation

You might have noticed that the previous Drawer isn't sliding out of anywhere (also we sneakily
added a type to the `Drawer` so that it could appear just like that). That's because we haven't
added the logic you would need to otherwise open the drawer.

I know what you're thinking. _Ugh, now I need to make state for this and have to worry about a bunch of
semantics right?_ Nope. If you just want a drawer that opens via a single button, you just have to use
the `Drawer.Button` component. If you were wondering why we didn't just use a regular `Button` and
pulled our magic that way, it's because the `Drawer` itself is a provider that probably wraps around
all kinds of front end, buttons included. To separate concern, we wanted to make it easy to identify
the button in charge of opening and closing the `Drawer`.

Once you have done that, pat yourself on the back because you have just implemented a fully functional
`Drawer`.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Standard Drawer" args={{}} height="300px">
        {StandardDrawer.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Orientation

You can choose where you want the drawer to pop out from by changing the `orientation` prop, by
default, we have it set to `"left"`, but you can change it to `"right"`, `"top"`, and `"bottom"`.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Orienting the Drawer" args={{ orientation: 'right' }} height="300px">
        {StandardDrawer.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Types

The `Drawer` implements the [Menu Component](?path=/docs/interfacing-menu--listbox-menu) to work,
this enables it to have accessibility features that come with it. That means you can do type
`home` to go to the first option, `end` to go to the last, and `esc` to collapse the `Drawer`
entirely. That isn't all, you can use the drawer in multiple ways:

-   **`absolute`:** implemented above, it will scale to 100% of whatever
    relative container it finds itself in
-   **`persistant`:** will shift whatever content is next to it to the side when
    open
-   **`permanent`:** will keep the menu open all the time, no button or toggle needed

#### `absolute`

That is the type of drawer we implemented in the beginning. This is the most common drawer that you
would typically see in the wild. Here all you have to do is add your `Dropdown.Button` and your
`Menu`, wherever you want, and you're good to go. The `Menu` will take up 100% of the dimensions of
the first `relative` positioned ancestor.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Absolute Drawer" args={{ label: 'Drawer' }} height="300px">
        {AbsoluteDrawer.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

#### `persistant`

This type of drawer will push the content blocking its way. For this example, we wanted the
component to nicely push the text to the left. To do this, we took advantage of the built in
integration of the `View` component. This lets us put our component specific children such as
the `Menu` and the `Dropdown.Button` into containers without losing its functionality.

A little bit of CSS to organize how everything will be displayed and boom, we have a smooth
transitioning, persistent, drawer.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Persistent Drawer" args={{ label: 'Drawer', type: 'persistent' }} height="300px">
        {PersistentDrawer.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

> As you may have noticed, this element only _really_ expands in two directions, vertically and
> horizontally. To distinguish left, right, bottom, and top, we added a divider on the orientation
> that will separate the content when expanded.

#### `permanent`

This last version of the drawer, will just render the menu without having to to toggle it. It's just
there if you wanted to keep some of the functionalities of the drawer. Although, this alternative
doesn't really provide much more functionality than your standard `Menu` component with extra styling.
We have it just in case you wanted it though.

<Canvas>
    <Story name="Permanent Drawer" args={{ label: 'Drawer', type: 'permanent' }} height="200px">
        {PermanentDrawer.bind({})}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

### Manual Controls

Sometimes we want more control on when a drawer opens or even how many drawers there are. For the
developers that need this kind of control for performance and other reasons, you can also add your
own opening/closing logic. There is an `open` that can override any built-in logic, as well as a
`toggleOpen` to input your state changing method of `open`. This gives you all the built in
functionality while retaining your control.
